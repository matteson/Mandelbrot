Simple plotter for the Mandelbrot set in OCaml. Output is a Graphics canvas within a box specified at the command line. The canvas is colored grey or black based on how many iterations are required for iteration escape.

This was mostly implemented while I was learning the basics of OCaml.

Compile with

ocamlopt Graphics.cmxa mandelbrot.ml -o mandel

then run with

./mandel

You will be prompted for the left, bottom corner of the bounding box, and the width of the box.

Good values for plotting a nice feature in the valley of elephants are:
Left side of box:
.323
Bottom of box:
.043
Width of box:
.027
